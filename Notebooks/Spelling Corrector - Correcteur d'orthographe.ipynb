    "## How It Works: \n",
    "### Some Probability Theory\n",
    "The call correction(w) tries to choose the most likely spelling correction for w. There is no way to know for sure (for example, should \"lates\" be corrected to \"late\" or \"latest\" or \"lattes\" or ...?), which suggests we use probabilities. We are trying to find the correction c, out of all possible candidate corrections, that maximizes the probability that c is the intended correction, given the original word w: argmaxc ∈ candidates P(c|w)\n",
    "\n",
    "By Bayes' Theorem this is equivalent to:\n",
    "argmaxc ∈ candidates P(c) P(w|c) / P(w)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since P(w) is the same for every possible candidate c, we can factor it out, giving:\n",
    "argmaxc ∈ candidates P(c) P(w|c)\n",
    "\n",
    "The four parts of this expression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Selection Mechanism: argmax\n",
    "We choose the candidate with the highest combined probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Candidate Model: c ∈ candidates\n",
    "This tells us which candidate corrections, c, to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Language Model: P(c)\n",
    "The probability that c appears as a word of English text. For example, occurrences of \"the\" make up about 7% of English text, so we should have P(the) = 0.07.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Error Model: P(w|c)\n",
    "The probability that w would be typed in a text when the author meant c. For example, P(teh|the) is relatively high, but P(theeexyz|the) would be very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious question is: why take a simple expression like P(c|w) and replace it with a more complex expression involving two models rather than one? The answer is that P(c|w) is already conflating two factors, and it is easier to separate the two out and deal with them explicitly. Consider the misspelled word w=\"thew\" and the two candidate corrections c=\"the\" and c=\"thaw\". Which has a higher P(c|w)? Well, \"thaw\" seems good because the only change is \"a\" to \"e\", which is a small change. On the other hand, \"the\" seems good because \"the\" is a very common word, and while adding a \"w\" seems like a larger, less probable change, perhaps the typist's finger slipped off the \"e\". The point is that to estimate P(c|w) we have to consider both the probability of c and the probability of the change from c to w anyway, so it is cleaner to formally separate the two factors."
